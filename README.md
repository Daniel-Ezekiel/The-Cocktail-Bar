## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Cocktail API

This project was built using HTML as the base structure with CSS for the styling. Postman (https://www.postman.com/) was used to test the Cocktail API before it was implemented with the JavaScript. Based on the data obtained from the API, DOM manipulation was carried out to change and display data obtained within the DOM.

The app provides a form to input the desired drink and search for that drink. The results are then displayed within the DOM using a carousel format.

The carousel format used is obtained and implemented using the **Swiper.js**  plugin

Within the fetch section in the JS, the body background was set to change on every response to the request to get an APOD to match the picture of the day.

## Optimizations

To further improve this app, there isn't any ingredients currently listed as part of the information displayed, so the app can be updated to display the ingredients for each cocktail/drink.  This will assist visitor to be able to make their own drinks from the comfort of their home provided that they have the ingredients.

Further improvements to this Web Application is to redevelop it(populate the slider, the DOM) using best practices instead of innerHTML like I did in this project.

## Lessons Learned:

This project helped me learn how to implement plugins like Swiper.js to suit the requirements for the project. It also helped me improve in reading and understanding documentation properly to be able to use tools effectively.

While building the Web Application, I made use of 'innerHTML' to populate the slider during DOM Manipulation. I understand that this isn't the best practice but I used this project to learn about using the innerHTML feature and I can confidently say that I understand it.
